# Development Notes

## Feature Ideas

- Add new Push Notifications explained screen that looks nicer and allows people to actively allow notifications. Add new notifications stack? Maybe thats a bit much.

- If someone doesn't have notifications on, have a useeffect with timeout that brings up a banner 'Allow notifications for the best experience'. This banner only comes up after you answer the daily question - don't want people to lose their response!

- Daily mood tracker 1-5 scale with graph output displayed on MyAnswers page

- Improve layout of Community Responses, testing with the max 10 shown

- Add React Native tests

- Consolidate endpoints on server and store data locally, allowing for offline use/checking
