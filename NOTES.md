Add new Push Notifications explained screen that looks nicer and allows people to actively allow notifications. Add new notifications stack? Maybe thats a bit much.

If someone doesn't have notifications on, have a useeffect with timeout that brings up a banner 'Allow notifications for the best experience'. This banner only comes up after you answer the daily question - don't want people to lose their response!
